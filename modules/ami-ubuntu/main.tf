/**
 * ## Ubuntu AMI lookup helper
 *
 * This module is a simple helper that looks up the current AMI ID for a given
 * release of ubuntu. Use it like:
 *
 * ```
 * module "ubuntu-xenial-ami" {
 *   source  = "../../tf-modules/ami-ubuntu"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Or for Trusty:
 *
 * ```
 * module "ubuntu-trusty-ami" {
 *   source  = "../../tf-modules/ami-ubuntu"
 *   release = "14.04"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To use the AMI on EC2, reference it by ID like this: `${module.ubuntu-xenial-ami.id}`
 *
 * The module will filter the AMI by the following criteria:
 *
 * * Canonical's account ARN (for either corporate or govcloud partitions)
 * * the most recent release
 * * hvm-type AMIs
 * * amd64
 * * the `name` filter
 *
 * The `name` filter looks like:
 *
 * ```
 * filter {
     name   = "name"
     values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-${var.name_map[var.release]}-${var.release}-amd64-server-*"]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you deploy an instance with this AMI, and later do a `terraform plan`, the
 * most recent AMI will be looked up, and that may change the module output, and
 * then the AMI for the instance. You can use `ignore_changes` or `-target`, to
 * work around that situation, or take that as your reminder to replace the
 * instance with a more recent release of the upstream AMI.
 *
